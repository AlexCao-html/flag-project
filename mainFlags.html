                    And where the body of the people, or any single man, is deprived of their right, or is under the exercise of a power without right, and have no appeal on earth, then they have a liberty to appeal to heaven, whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment. And therefore, though the people cannot be judge, so as to have, by the constitution of that society, any superior power, to determine and give effective sentence in the case; yet they have, by a law antecedent and paramount to all positive laws of men, reserved that ultimate determination to themselves which belongs to all mankind, where there lies no appeal on earth, viz. to judge, whether they have just cause to make their appeal to heaven.

                    <h2>The Star Sprangled Banner</h2>
                    O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,<br />
                    What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming,<br />
                    Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight<br />
                    O'er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming?<br />
                    And the rocket's red glare, the bomb bursting in air,<br />
                    Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,<br />
                    O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br />
                    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?<br />
<br />
                    On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep<br />
                    Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,<br />
                    What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,<br />
                    As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?<br />
                    Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,<br />
                    In full glory reflected now shines in the stream,<br />
                    'Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave<br />
                    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!<br />
<br />
                    And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,<br />
                    That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion<br />
                    A home and a Country should leave us no more?<br />
                    Their blood has wash'd out their foul footstep's pollution.<br />
                    No refuge could save the hireling and slave<br />
                    From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,<br />
                    And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave<br />
                    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br />
<br />
                    O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand<br />
                    Between their lov'd home and the war's desolation!<br />
                    Blest with vict'ry and peace may the heav'n rescued land<br />
                    Praise the power that hath made and preserv'd us a nation!<br />
                    Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,<br />
                    And this be our motto - "In God is our trust,"<br />
                    And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave<br />
                    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br />

                    <h2>Types of flags</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only flags made specifically for exterior use should be displayed outdoors. </li>
                        <li>Do not expose your flag to rain, snow, or high winds. These will shorten its life. </li>
                        <li><strong>Do not fly a wet flag. </strong>Flying a heavy, wet flag in the wind puts high strain on the fabric and stitching. This will immensely reduce the life of your flag</li>
                        <li>If the flag becomes wet, it should be spread out and be able to dry completely. Do not fold or roll up a wet or damp flag.</li>
                        <li>To keep its colors looking bright, clean your flag regularly, before soiling and discoloration from dirt, smoke, dust and other contaminants.</li>
                        <li>Outdoor flags can be hand-washed with warm water and a mild soap, then rinsed thoroughly. Finaly, spread it out to dry.</li>
                        <li>Professional dry cleaning is recommended for indoor/parade flags. Also, some establishments will clean the flag for free of charge.</li>
                        <li>Do not place the flag where the wind will whip it against rough surfaces, tree branches, wires, cables, etc. A miniscule tear can soon result in a ripped-up flag.</li>
                        <li>Keep pole surfaces away from heavy dirt, rust, scale and corrosion that could damage your flag.</li>
                        <li>Inspect your flag regularly for signs of wear. In particular, look for "normal wear" fabric or thread breaks which may occur in the the end farthest from the pole. Trimming off and re-hemming torn or frayed ends will help extend the life of your flag.</li>
