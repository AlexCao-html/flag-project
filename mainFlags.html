                <p>The Grand Union Flag's designer was unknown. This is the only American flag with out the stars (except the pine tree flag). Instead, it has a British Flag because it was a colony at the time. This flag was used in late 1775 to 1777.</p>

                    <h2>Preamble to the Declaration of Independence</h2>
                    The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

                    And where the body of the people, or any single man, is deprived of their right, or is under the exercise of a power without right, and have no appeal on earth, then they have a liberty to appeal to heaven, whenever they judge the cause of sufficient moment. And therefore, though the people cannot be judge, so as to have, by the constitution of that society, any superior power, to determine and give effective sentence in the case; yet they have, by a law antecedent and paramount to all positive laws of men, reserved that ultimate determination to themselves which belongs to all mankind, where there lies no appeal on earth, viz. to judge, whether they have just cause to make their appeal to heaven.

                    <h2>The Star Sprangled Banner</h2>
                    O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,<br />
                    What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming,<br />
                    Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight<br />
                    O'er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming?<br />
                    And the rocket's red glare, the bomb bursting in air,<br />
                    Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,<br />
                    O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave<br />
                    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?<br />
<br />
                    On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep<br />
                    Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,<br />
                    What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,<br />
                    As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?<br />
                    Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,<br />
                    In full glory reflected now shines in the stream,<br />
                    'Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave<br />
                    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!<br />
<br />
                    And where is that band who so vauntingly swore,<br />
                    That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion<br />
                    A home and a Country should leave us no more?<br />
                    Their blood has wash'd out their foul footstep's pollution.<br />
                    No refuge could save the hireling and slave<br />
                    From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,<br />
                    And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave<br />
                    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br />
<br />
                    O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand<br />
                    Between their lov'd home and the war's desolation!<br />
                    Blest with vict'ry and peace may the heav'n rescued land<br />
                    Praise the power that hath made and preserv'd us a nation!<br />
                    Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,<br />
                    And this be our motto - "In God is our trust,"<br />
                    And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave<br />
                    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br />
